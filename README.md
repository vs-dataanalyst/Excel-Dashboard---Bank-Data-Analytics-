The aim of the project has been on analysing and visualising bank’s loan data with respect to customers, to gain insights and analyse the KPI’s. The analysis will focus on customers with varied grades and sub-grade levels, revolving balance values, loan status for states, purpose of loan, employment length of customer etc. 
<br><br>
The dataset I have used are as follows: 
<br>
1. Finance_1.csv <br>
2. Finance_2.xlsx <br>
<br>
I have merged the two files and cleaned the data for analysis purpose. For cleaning the data I have used power query and microsoft excel. In cleaning, I have transformed the data types, formatting,  check nulls, removed unwanted data etc. Hypothetical data is used for analysis.

## The conclusions and findings:
1.	The data shows that the loan amount has been increasing year-on-year,  from the year 2007 to 2011 it has increased from 2.22 Million to 260 Million which indicates that bank can plan to increase its lending capacity to meet the growing demand.<br>

2.	Maximum people i.e 63% of customers are opting for 36 months (3 Yrs) loan duration, where as 37% are opting for 60 months (5 Yrs)  loan duration. This difference can be because of lower average interest rate for 3 yrs is 11% and for 5 yrs is 15%. This information can help bank to focus their marketing effort on 5 yr loan plan.<br>

3.	California is the state with highest number of customers  i.e 7099, second is New York with 3812 customers and third is florida with 2866 customers. The bank can find the best marketing practises implemented in these states and apply them in other states as well.<br>

4.	The most common purpose of loan taken is debt consolidation for which total loan amount is (236 M) then followed by credit card (60 M) , home improvement (34 M).<br> 

5.	The maximum loan ie 27% of loan is taken by the borrowers who are employeed for more than 10 years. Then on second rank are the borrowers who are employeed between 1 to 4 yrs has taken on average 10% loan each. The people who are employeed between 5-9 yrs has taken least amount of loan. From this we can conclude that people on extremes of employment yrs are taking more loan. Bank can focus on these customers more.<br>

6.	Revolving balance is higher for B3, B4, B5 overall the revolving balance is higher for B grade, bank can identify and take corrective actions and tailor stratergies to minimise the future risk.<br>
